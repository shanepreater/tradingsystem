<h3>RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FOREX TRADING</h3>
<p>Trading foreign currencies can be a challenging and potentially profitable opportunity for investors. However, before
    deciding to participate in the Forex market, you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of
    experience, and risk appetite. Most importantly, do not invest money you cannot afford to lose.</p>
<p>There is considerable exposure to risk in any foreign exchange transaction. Any transaction involving currencies
    involves risks including, but not limited to, the potential for changing political and/or economic conditions that
    may substantially affect the price or liquidity of a currency. Investments in foreign exchange speculation may also
    be susceptible to sharp rises and falls as the relevant market values fluctuate. The leveraged nature of Forex
    trading means that any market movement will have an equally proportional effect on your deposited funds. This may
    work against you as well as for you. Not only may investors get back less than they invested, but in the case of
    higher risk strategies, investors may lose the entirety of their investment. It is for this reason that when
    speculating in such markets it is advisable to use only risk capital.</p>

<p>Currency trading offers amazing profit potential, but includes also large risk potential. Therefore, currency trading
    on margin may not be suitable for all individuals. The high leverage offered in the currency market can work against
    you as well as for you.</p>
<p>Before you get started with trading in the foreign exchange market with Opportunity Watcher, and indeed, any other
    trading system, you should consider your investment goals, objectives, trading experience and your personal risk
    appetite. You should be also aware of the existing possibility that you could lose some or, in the worst case, all
    of your initial investment. For this reason, currency trading should only be undertaken with risk capital. The
    definition of risk capital is the funds that are not necessary to the survival or well being of the user. Make
    yourself aware of all possible risks associated with trading currencies on margin. If you have any doubts or
    concerns you should seek advice form an independent financial advisor.</p>
